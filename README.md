# OneFileWonder

## What is this?

Boilerplate for a one-file self-contained HTML app/document.

Takes something like the concept of [https://unhosted.org/](https://unhosted.org/) but requires everything to fit into a single HTML file.

Perfect for internal organisational use (send a HTML file around and your colleagues / clients / students can open it in any modern web browser).
